# Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

## Issues Addressed

This commit addresses the following security vulnerabilities identified in the security scan:

### 1. ✅ CSP: script-src unsafe-eval

**Status: RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Content Security Policy contained `'unsafe-eval'` in script-src directive
- **Risk**: Allows evaluation of strings as JavaScript, potentially enabling XSS attacks
- **Fix**:
  - Implemented environment-specific CSP policies
  - In production: Removed `'unsafe-eval'`, uses strict nonce-based CSP
  - In development: Kept minimal `'unsafe-eval'` only for Vite HMR compatibility
  - Added nonce generation for secure inline script execution

### 2. ✅ CSP: script-src unsafe-inline

**Status: RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Content Security Policy contained `'unsafe-inline'` in script-src directive
- **Risk**: Allows inline JavaScript execution, major XSS vulnerability vector
- **Fix**:
  - Replaced `'unsafe-inline'` with nonce-based CSP (`'nonce-{random}'`)
  - In production: Completely removed unsafe-inline for scripts
  - In development: Limited unsafe-inline only to styles for Ant Design compatibility

### 3. ✅ Cross-Domain Misconfiguration

**Status: RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: CORS configured with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` (wildcard)
- **Risk**: Allows any website to make cross-origin requests, potential data exposure
- **Fix**:
  - **Frontend**: Restricted to specific allowed origins: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
  - **Backend**: Implemented origin validation function with allowlist
  - **Production**: Uses environment variable `FRONTEND_URL` for allowed origins
  - **Verification**: Tested that unauthorized origins don't receive CORS headers

### 4. ✅ Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By"

**Status: RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Express.js was exposing `X-Powered-By: Express` header
- **Risk**: Information disclosure helps attackers identify server technology and potential vulnerabilities
- **Fix**:
  - **Backend**: Added `app.disable('x-powered-by')` to remove Express header
  - **Frontend**: Added explicit header removal in security middleware
  - **Verification**: Confirmed X-Powered-By header no longer present in responses

## Additional Security Improvements

### Enhanced Security Headers

- **Strict Transport Security (HSTS)**: Added in production mode with 1-year max-age
- **Server Header Removal**: Prevents server software version disclosure
- **Enhanced Referrer Policy**: Set to `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- **Nonce Generation**: Cryptographically secure random nonces for each request

### Environment-Aware Security

- **Development Mode**: Minimal security relaxation only where needed for Vite HMR
- **Production Mode**: Strict security policies with no compromises
- **Conditional Headers**: HSTS and other production-specific headers only in production

## Testing and Verification

### Security Headers Test Results

```
✅ Content-Security-Policy: PRESENT (with nonces)
✅ X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
✅ X-Frame-Options: DENY
✅ Access-Control-Allow-Origin: Restricted to allowed origins
✅ X-Powered-By: Removed
✅ Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### CORS Testing

- ✅ Authorized origins (`http://localhost:3000`): Receive proper CORS headers
- ✅ Unauthorized origins: Do not receive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header
- ✅ Credentials support maintained for authorized origins

## Files Modified

1. **`frontend/security-middleware.js`**

   - Enhanced CSP with environment-specific policies
   - Added nonce-based script/style security
   - Implemented restrictive CORS configuration
   - Added comprehensive security headers

2. **`backend/src/app.js`**
   - Disabled X-Powered-By header
   - Enhanced CORS with origin validation
   - Maintained existing helmet CSP configuration

## Compliance Status

| Security Standard     | Status   | Notes                                        |
| --------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| OWASP Top 10 2021 A05 | ✅ Fixed | Security misconfiguration resolved           |
| OWASP Top 10 2017 A06 | ✅ Fixed | Security misconfiguration resolved           |
| CWE-693               | ✅ Fixed | Protection mechanism failure resolved        |
| CWE-264               | ✅ Fixed | Permissions/privileges/access controls fixed |

## Recommendations for Production Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `FRONTEND_URL` is properly set in production
2. **HTTPS**: Enable HTTPS to activate HSTS headers
3. **CSP Monitoring**: Consider adding CSP reporting endpoints for violation monitoring
4. **Regular Security Scans**: Run periodic security scans to detect new issues

## Development Impact

- ✅ Frontend HMR (Hot Module Replacement) continues to work
- ✅ Ant Design styles render correctly
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ✅ Enhanced security without development workflow disruption
