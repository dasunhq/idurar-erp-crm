# Security Fixes - Snyk Vulnerabilities Report
**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Author**: Security Team  
**Report**: Snyk vulnerability scan dated October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary
Fixed 5 known vulnerabilities identified by Snyk security scan affecting 5 vulnerable dependency paths across 761 dependencies.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. Critical: Predictable Value Range from Previous Values (form-data)
- **Package**: form-data@2.3.3 (via html-pdf → phantomjs-prebuilt → request)
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Issue**: Predictable boundary values using Math.random()
- **Fix**: Replaced html-pdf with puppeteer for PDF generation
- **Impact**: Prevents HTTP parameter pollution attacks

### 2. Medium: Prototype Pollution (tough-cookie)
- **Package**: tough-cookie@2.5.0 (via html-pdf → phantomjs-prebuilt → request)
- **Severity**: Medium  
- **Issue**: Prototype pollution when using CookieJar in rejectPublicSuffixes=false mode
- **Fix**: Eliminated dependency by replacing html-pdf with puppeteer
- **Impact**: Prevents prototype pollution attacks

### 3. Medium: Server-side Request Forgery (request)
- **Package**: request@2.88.2 (via html-pdf → phantomjs-prebuilt)
- **Severity**: Medium
- **Issue**: Insufficient checks allowing insecure redirects (deprecated package)
- **Fix**: Eliminated dependency by replacing html-pdf with puppeteer
- **Impact**: Prevents SSRF attacks through insecure redirects

### 4 & 5. Medium: Arbitrary File Upload (express-fileupload)
- **Package**: express-fileupload@1.4.3
- **Severity**: Medium (2 instances)
- **Issue**: Multiple arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities with no available fix
- **Fix**: Replaced with multer@2.0.2 with enhanced security controls
- **Impact**: Prevents arbitrary file upload attacks

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Package Dependencies Updated
```json
{
  "removed": {
    "html-pdf": "^3.0.1",
    "express-fileupload": "^1.4.3"
  },
  "added": {
    "puppeteer": "^22.0.0"
  },
  "existing_secure": {
    "multer": "^2.0.2"
  }
}
```

### 2. PDF Generation Migration
- **Before**: html-pdf (uses phantomjs-prebuilt with vulnerable dependencies)
- **After**: puppeteer (modern, secure, actively maintained)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Eliminates form-data, tough-cookie, and request vulnerabilities
  - Better performance and reliability
  - Active security maintenance
  - Modern web standards support

### 3. File Upload Security Enhancement
- **Before**: express-fileupload (vulnerable, no fixes available)
- **After**: multer (already in use, secure alternative)
- **Security Improvements**:
  - File type validation
  - Size limits
  - Path traversal protection
  - Memory management

## Security Enhancements Added

1. **Enhanced File Upload Validation**: Added strict file type and size validation
2. **Path Traversal Protection**: Implemented secure file path handling
3. **Memory Management**: Added limits to prevent DoS attacks
4. **Security Headers**: Enhanced CSP and security headers for file operations

## Testing Performed

- [x] PDF generation functionality verified with puppeteer
- [x] File upload functionality tested with multer
- [x] Security validation for file operations
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scan (clean)
- [x] Application functionality regression testing

## Risk Assessment

**Before Fix**: 
- 1 Critical vulnerability (HTTP parameter pollution)
- 4 Medium vulnerabilities (Prototype pollution, SSRF, Arbitrary file upload x2)

**After Fix**: 
- 0 Critical vulnerabilities
- 0 Medium vulnerabilities from identified packages
- Enhanced security posture with modern alternatives

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Scans**: Implement automated Snyk/npm audit in CI/CD
2. **Dependency Updates**: Regular security updates for all dependencies
3. **Security Testing**: Include security tests in development workflow
4. **Alternative Monitoring**: Monitor for new vulnerabilities in puppeteer and multer

## Compliance Notes

- Changes maintain existing functionality while improving security
- Modern alternatives chosen for long-term maintainability
- Zero-downtime deployment compatible
- Backward compatibility preserved for API endpoints
