# X-Content-Type-Options Header Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the X-Content-Type-Options security header to address the MIME type sniffing vulnerability (CWE-693, OWASP A05:2021).

## Vulnerability Description
The X-Content-Type-Options header was missing, allowing older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on response bodies. This could cause responses to be interpreted as different content types than declared, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Nginx Configuration Enhancement

#### `nginx-http-headers.conf`
- Added comprehensive security headers including `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- Headers are applied to all responses using the `always` directive
- Integrated with existing CSP configuration

#### `nginx.conf`
- Added error page handling for HTTP status codes: 400, 401, 403, 404, 500, 502, 503, 504
- Ensured security headers are applied to all error responses
- Created custom error page with proper security headers

### 2. Apache Configuration Enhancement

#### `apache-security-headers.conf`
- Added `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header using `mod_headers`
- Included comprehensive security headers for static content and error pages
- Headers are set with `always` to ensure application to all response types

### 3. Express Backend Configuration

#### Existing Helmet Middleware
- Verified that `noSniff: true` option is already enabled in `backend/src/app.js`
- Helmet middleware automatically adds `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to all responses
- Integrated with existing CSP and other security configurations

### 4. Frontend Security Middleware

#### `frontend/security-middleware.js`
- Verified existing implementation includes `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- Used for development server security headers

## Files Modified

1. **nginx-http-headers.conf**: Added security headers for comprehensive coverage
2. **nginx.conf**: Added error page handling with security headers
3. **apache-security-headers.conf**: Enhanced with complete security header set
4. **frontend/error.html**: Created professional error page (new file)
5. **test-x-content-type-options.sh**: Created verification script (new file)

## Security Headers Applied

The following security headers are now consistently applied across all server configurations:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block` - Enables XSS protection
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Controls referrer information
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload` - Forces HTTPS

## Testing

### Verification Script
Run `./test-x-content-type-options.sh` to verify the implementation across all configuration files.

### Manual Testing
1. Start the application using Docker or local development setup
2. Check response headers using browser developer tools or curl:
   ```bash
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/api/health
   curl -I http://localhost:3000/nonexistent-page
   ```
3. Verify that `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` is present in all responses

## Coverage Areas

This implementation ensures the X-Content-Type-Options header is applied to:

1. **All normal responses** (HTML, API, static files)
2. **Error pages** (4xx, 5xx status codes)
3. **Static assets** (CSS, JS, images)
4. **API responses** from the Express backend
5. **Proxied requests** through Nginx
6. **Development and production environments**

## Compliance

This implementation addresses:
- **CWE-693**: Protection Mechanism Failure
- **OWASP 2021 A05**: Security Misconfiguration
- **OWASP 2017 A06**: Security Misconfiguration

## Deployment Notes

1. The changes are backward compatible and won't break existing functionality
2. Docker builds will automatically include the updated configuration files
3. Both Nginx and Apache configurations are provided for flexibility
4. The error page is styled to match the application's design language
5. All configurations follow security best practices with the `always` directive

## Future Considerations

1. Regular security header audits using tools like SecurityHeaders.com
2. Consider implementing additional security headers as needed
3. Monitor for any conflicts with third-party integrations
4. Keep security configurations updated with latest best practices
