# CSP Improvement Plan

This document outlines the Content Security Policy (CSP) improvements implemented to address security vulnerabilities identified in the Wapiti vulnerability scan report.

## Security Headers Implemented

The following security headers have been added to both frontend and backend services:

1. **Content-Security-Policy (CSP)**

   - Restricts which resources can be loaded
   - Prevents XSS attacks
   - Uses nonce-based approach for inline scripts/styles

2. **X-Content-Type-Options**

   - Set to "nosniff"
   - Prevents MIME type sniffing

3. **X-Frame-Options**

   - Set to "DENY"
   - Prevents clickjacking attacks by disallowing framing of the application

4. **X-XSS-Protection**

   - Set to "1; mode=block"
   - Enables browser's built-in XSS filtering

5. **Strict-Transport-Security**
   - Set to "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains"
   - Forces HTTPS connections for one year
   - Includes all subdomains

## Implementation Details

### Frontend (Vite Development Server)

Security headers are implemented using a custom Vite plugin and middleware in `security-middleware.js` that:

- Generates a unique nonce for each request
- Applies all required security headers
- Configures CSP with appropriate directives

### Backend (Express Server)

Security headers are implemented using the Helmet middleware with:

- Enhanced CSP configuration
- HSTS settings
- Other security headers properly configured

## Further Improvements

1. Consider implementing a report-uri directive in the CSP to monitor policy violations
2. Regular security scans to verify header implementations
3. Review and refine CSP directives as the application evolves
4. Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for externally loaded resources
