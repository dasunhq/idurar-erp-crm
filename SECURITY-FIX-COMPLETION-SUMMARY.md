## Solution Implementation

### 📦 Package Changes
```json
{
  "removed": [
    "html-pdf@3.0.1",
    "express-fileupload@1.4.3"
  ],
  "added": [
    "puppeteer@24.23.0"
  ],
  "enhanced": [
    "multer@2.0.2 (already present, now primary file upload handler)"
  ]
}
```

### 🛠️ Code Modifications

#### 1. PDF Generation (Security Critical)
- **Before**: `html-pdf` with vulnerable dependency chain
- **After**: `puppeteer` with secure, headless Chrome
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/pdfController/index.js`
- **Security Improvements**:
  - No vulnerable dependencies
  - Sandbox security flags
  - Modern PDF generation
  - Active security maintenance

#### 2. File Upload Security (Enhanced)
- **Before**: `express-fileupload` (vulnerable, no fixes available)  
- **After**: Enhanced `multer` with comprehensive security
- **File**: `backend/src/middlewares/secureUpload.js`
- **Security Features**:
  - File type validation (extension + MIME)
  - Size limits per category
  - Path traversal protection
  - Secure filename generation
  - Upload limits enforcement

#### 3. Application Security (Hardened)
- **File**: `backend/src/app.js`
- **Changes**: Removed all vulnerable middleware imports
- **Documentation**: Added security comments explaining changes
